Many people had doubts about how Looset would behave in large projects, or if a simple analyzer could deliver some useful information. Well, I would like to build the whole product as I envisioned in the [demo video](https://youtu.be/TW5c8V33-rk), but I can not afford to spend this time. So I created a much smaller version of Looset Diagram. This MVP took me around 60 hours of work, so it was a good test for my estimative of 320 hours for the whole project.

I ran Looset Diagram in some Open Source code-bases, check it out the list below.

## Looset Diagrams on some projects
- [Shazwazza/Articulate](https://jponline.github.io/looset-diagram-mvp/?project=Shazwazza/Articulate) (C#)
- [mapbox/mapbox-gl-draw](https://jponline.github.io/looset-diagram-mvp/) (Javascript)

If you want your project in this list let me know.

If you see value in this product, this is the last chance you have to help me build it. Take a look at [The Kickstarter Campaign](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/looset-team/looset?ref=1i0fmm), there's only a few hours before it finishes.
